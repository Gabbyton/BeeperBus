### BeeperBus Project

BeeperBus is a school project founded on the belief that everyone deserves a better bus experience here at CWRU. Our goal is to foster better communication between riders and drivers for the shuttles on CWRU campus. We plan on leveraging data analysis and machine learning tools to better understand driver and rider behavior. We then aim to produce displays that can be put in dorms and bus stops. We also plan to prototype apps that drivers can use to signify break times.
